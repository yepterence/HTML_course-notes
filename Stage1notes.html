			<h2 class="subheading-1">Google Chrome developer tools</h2>
			<p>
			Google Chrome has an in-built functionality that allows the user to investigate the structure of the page and the styles that were being used. It should be noted that the elements are:
			</p>
			<ul class="square">
				<li>Rectangular</li>
				<li>Not all of the elements are available for eg., &quot;head&quot; element</li>
				<li>All text is same as the text on the page</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			HTML pages have a <span class="important">tree-like </span> structure where, tags are sub-classified certain sections of the documents. The browser organizes these tags into a tree with the help of DOM <span class="important">&#40;Document Object Model&#41;</span> Each tag can have an attribute with a value, for eg., &quot;class&quot; &#40;attribute&#41;=&quot;title&quot;&#40;value&#41;.

 			<h2 class="subheading-1">Cascade Styling Sheets (CSS)
 			</h2>
 			<p>
 			Allows the user to change how the elements will look in the document using a language with specific set of syntax and rules. It helps define the positioning, color, etc., of the elements.
 			</p>

 				<h3 class="subheading-2">Arrangement of elements in an HTML</h3>
 				<p>
 				All elements are arranged in the form of boxes stacked on top of one another.
 				<br>
 				<b>Note from expert</b>&#58;It is best to write/draw out your project on paper and isolate the content into boxes. Start from the big boxes and then get to the small boxes.
 				<br>
 				&quot;<span class="important">&lt;div&gt;</span>&quot;is a great for organizing your content in your html document and the addition of &quot;<span class="important">class</span>&quot; to your div tags makes it easier to style the document when it does become more complex and it also helps by reducing <span class="important">repetition</span> in your document.
 				</p>
 				</div>
 			<div>
			<h2 class="subheading-1">The Box Model
			</h2>
			</div>
			<p>
			All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term <span class="important">"box model"</span> is used when talking about design and layout. The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of&#58;
			</p>
			<ul class="square">
				<li>Content - Centermost element, text/ content, other elements protect it, like a nucleus so that it does not get mixed up with other content on the page</li>
				<li>Padding - green colored. clears an area around content and is afected by the bg color of the box and is the box that protects content directly</li>
				<li>border inherits the color property of the box</li>
				<li>Margin - Outermost, space between boxes. </li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h2 class="subheading-1">Code-Test-Refine</h2>
				<p>
				In order to streamline web development, the steps stated below can be followed&#58;
				</p>
			</div>
				<ul class="square">
					<li>Define the structure of the page. Classify everything into its<span class="important"> &quot;natural&quot; boxes</span>. </li>
					<li>Look for repeated styles and semantic elements. Input appropriate tags</li>
					<li>Size of the boxes</li>
					<li>Position boxes</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
				Once these have been determined. The finer details can be applied to the HTML.
				</p>
				<div>
					<h3 class="subheading-2">Customizing box position</h3>
					<p>
						In order to change the position of your boxes, it will be necessary to change its dimenisions and properties in the page's <span class="important">CSS file </span>or through <span class="important">Google Chrome's developer tools</span>.
						Images and text can be arranged differently by adding &quot;<span class="important">display&#58;flex</span>&quot; function in the CSS file. For eg. This image below can be placed side by side with text.
